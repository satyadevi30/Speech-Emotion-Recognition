# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
## Project Overview:
Speech Emotion Recognition, abbreviated as SER, is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. This is capitalizing on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. This is also the phenomenon that animals like dogs and horses employ to be able to understand human emotion.
Speech Emotion Recognition project aims to develop a system capable of automatically detecting emotions from speech signals. We start by collecting a dataset of speech samples labeled with corresponding emotions. Preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and standardize the audio data. Feature extraction methods such as MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) are used to capture relevant information from the speech signals. Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are trained on the extracted features to classify emotions. The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score to assess its performance. We then fine-tune the model and optimize hyperparameters to improve its accuracy. Finally, we deploy the trained model into a real-world application where it can accurately recognize emotions in speech in realtime.
## Key Features:
#### 1.MFCCs:
MFCCs are widely used in speech processing to capture spectral characteristics. They represent the power spectrum of the audio signal on a nonlinear mel scale.
#### 2.Pitch and Pitch Contour:
Pitch represents the fundamental frequency of the speech signal, which can vary with different emotions. Pitch contour analysis can capture variations in pitch over time, which may correlate with certain.
#### 3.Energy:
Energy represents the intensity or loudness of the speech signal. Emotions liÔe anger or excitement may be associated with higher energy levels.
#### 4.Format Frequencies:
Formants are resonance frequencies in the speech signal that are related to the shape of the vocal tract. Changes in formant frequencies may reflect different emotional states
#### 5.Speech Rate:
The rate of speech, measured in words per minute, may vary with emotional arousal. Faster speech rates may indicate excitement or agitation, while slower rates may indicate calmness or sadness.
#### 6.Zero Crossing Rate:
Zero crossing rate measures the rate at which the speech signal changes its sign. IIt can provide information about the temporal dynamics of the speech signal, which may be relevant for emotion recognition.
## RNNs:
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a network architecture for deep learning that predicts on time-series or sequential data. RNNs are particularly effective for working with sequential data that varies in length and solving problems such as natural signal classification, language processing, and video analysis. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a special type of RNN that is better in learning longer term dependencies than simple RNNs. Recurrent neural networks (RNN): Best for sequential data, such as time series analysis (think stock market analysis or weather forecasting), language modeling, and speech recognition.
## LSTM:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was brought into the picture. It has been so designed that the vanishing gradient problem is almost completely removed, while the training model is left unaltered. Long-time lags in certain problems are bridged using LSTMs which also handle noise, distributed representations, and continuous values. With LSTMs, there is no need to keep a finite number of states from beforehand as required in the hidden Markov model (HMM). LSTMs provide us with a large range of parameters such as learning rates, and input and output biases.
## Conclusion:
The Speech Emotion Recognition project using the Toronto dataset successfully developed a robust system capable of accurately identifying emotions from speech. The project achieved several key milestones, including the effective preprocessing of audio data, the implementation of various machine learning models, and the deployment of a functional model for real-time applications. The project not only demonstrated the feasibility of recognizing emotions from speech but also highlighted the importance of data quality, model selection, and continuous evaluation in building reliable machine learning systems.
This project contributes to the field of data science by providing a practical solution to a complex problem with wide-ranging applications, such as improving human-computer interaction, enhancing customer service, and aiding mental health assessments. The insights gained from handling imbalanced datasets, feature selection, and model optimization are valuable lessons for similar data science projects.
The project underscores the critical role of data science in processing and analyzing unstructured data, such as audio. It showcases the potential of machine learning and deep learning in transforming raw data into actionable insights. Moreover, the project highlights the importance of iterative development, experimentation, and adaptation, which are key principles in the data science field.
In summary, this project not only advanced the technical aspects of speech emotion recognition but also reinforced the broader relevance of data science in solving real-world problems and creating impactful solutions.
